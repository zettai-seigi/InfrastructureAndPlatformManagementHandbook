# Infrastructure and Platform Management Handbook
{: .fs-9 }

A Comprehensive Guide to ITIL/ITSM Infrastructure and Platform Management Best Practices
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## Welcome

Welcome to the **Infrastructure and Platform Management Handbook**, a comprehensive guide designed for IT professionals, infrastructure teams, and organizations seeking to establish, improve, or optimize their infrastructure and platform management practices aligned with ITIL 4 and industry best practices.

This handbook provides a structured approach to managing IT infrastructure and platforms, covering everything from strategy and architecture to operations, automation, and continuous optimization. It addresses on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments, providing practical guidance for modern infrastructure challenges.

## What You Will Learn

This handbook covers the complete infrastructure and platform management lifecycle:

### Strategy and Planning
- Infrastructure strategy development and roadmapping
- Capacity planning and demand management
- Technology selection and evaluation
- Investment planning and business cases

### Architecture and Design
- Infrastructure architecture patterns and principles
- Cloud architecture (IaaS, PaaS, hybrid, multi-cloud)
- Network design and security architecture
- High availability and disaster recovery design

### Build and Deployment
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices
- Automated provisioning and configuration
- Container platforms and orchestration
- CI/CD for infrastructure

### Operations and Management
- Monitoring, observability, and alerting
- Incident response and troubleshooting
- Patch management and maintenance
- Capacity and performance management

### Governance and Optimization
- Infrastructure governance frameworks
- Cost management and FinOps
- Security and compliance
- Continuous improvement and modernization

## Key Frameworks

### The Infrastructure Lifecycle

This handbook is built around the complete infrastructure lifecycle:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Plan** | Strategy development, capacity planning, technology evaluation |
| **Design** | Architecture design, standards definition, solution design |
| **Build** | Provisioning, configuration, automation development |
| **Deploy** | Deployment execution, testing, validation |
| **Operate** | Monitoring, maintenance, support, incident response |
| **Optimize** | Performance tuning, cost optimization, modernization |
| **Retire** | Decommissioning, migration, data archival |

### 8 Critical Success Factors

1. **Executive Sponsorship** - Leadership commitment to infrastructure investment and modernization
2. **Clear Infrastructure Strategy** - Defined architecture principles, standards, and roadmap
3. **Skilled Infrastructure Teams** - Investment in talent development and modern skills
4. **Modern Toolchain** - Appropriate automation, monitoring, and management tools
5. **Automation First** - Infrastructure as Code and automated operations as default
6. **Security Integration** - Security embedded in infrastructure design and operations
7. **Cost Awareness** - FinOps practices and continuous cost optimization
8. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular assessment and optimization of infrastructure

### 6 Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Infrastructure Availability | Greater than 99.95% |
| Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) | Less than 1 hour |
| Change Success Rate | Greater than 98% |
| Patch Compliance | Greater than 95% |
| Automation Coverage | Greater than 80% |
| Cost Variance | Less than 10% from budget |

### 5 Maturity Levels

1. **Ad-hoc** - No formal processes, reactive management, manual operations
2. **Managed** - Basic processes, some monitoring, limited automation
3. **Defined** - Standardized processes, documented architecture, IaC adoption
4. **Measured** - Metrics-driven, proactive management, comprehensive automation
5. **Optimized** - Continuous improvement, self-healing, predictive operations
