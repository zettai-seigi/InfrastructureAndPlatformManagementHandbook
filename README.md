## Key Framework Elements

### 8 Critical Success Factors
1. Executive Sponsorship and Strategic Alignment
2. Comprehensive Architecture and Design
3. Automation and Infrastructure as Code
4. Security and Compliance Integration
5. Observability and Monitoring
6. Operational Excellence and Reliability
7. Cost Optimization and FinOps
8. Continuous Improvement and Learning

### 6 Key Performance Indicators
1. System Availability (target: ≥99.9%)
2. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (target: <30 min)
3. Change Success Rate (target: ≥95%)
4. Infrastructure as Code Coverage (target: ≥95%)
5. Cost Efficiency (cost per transaction decreasing)
6. Security Compliance Score (target: ≥95%)

### 5 Maturity Levels
1. Ad-hoc (Initial) - Manual, reactive operations
2. Developing (Basic) - Documented processes, basic automation
3. Defined (Standardized) - IaC, CI/CD, observability
4. Managed (Measured) - Data-driven, advanced automation
5. Optimizing (Continuous) - Self-healing, continuous improvement
